# File Cursor 📚

Imagine you're reading a book. When you read, you use your finger to follow the text. That's exactly how the file cursor works in Python!

## How Does It Work? 🤔

1. **Opening the File**
```python
file = open("my_file.txt", "r")
```
It's like opening a book to the first page. The cursor is at the very beginning.

2. **Reading**
```python
# First reading
content = file.readlines()  # The cursor goes to the end
# Second reading
content2 = file.readlines()  # ⚠️ Will return nothing because the cursor is already at the end!
```

## A Practical Demonstration 🎯

```python
# Here's what happens when reading a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as f:
    # The cursor is at the beginning ⬇️
    first_line = f.readline()  # The cursor moves forward one line
    second_line = f.readline()  # The cursor moves forward again
    
    # If you want to go back to the beginning
    f.seek(0)  # The cursor returns to the beginning ⬅️
```

## Why Is This Important? 🎓

In your exercise, when you do:
```python
content = file.readlines()
csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)  # ⚠️ Will not work!
```

The problem is that:
1. `readlines()` has already moved the cursor to the end of the file
2. `DictReader` finds nothing to read because the cursor is at the end!

## The Solution 💡

```python
with open("data/my_file.csv", "r") as file:
    # Either use readlines()
    content = file.readlines()
    
    # OR use DictReader, but not both!
    # file.seek(0)  # If you really want to use both
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
```

## Golden Rule 🌟

Don't mix reading methods unless you use `seek(0)` to reset the cursor. Choose a method and stick to it!

I hope this explanation helps you better understand why your code wasn't working when trying to use both reading methods simultaneously! 😊
